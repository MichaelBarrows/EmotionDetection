This code is part of the research project titled "Iranian State-Sponsored Propaganda on Twitter: Exploring Methods for Automatic Classification and Analysis".

<h3>Project</h3>
<hr style="margin:10px 0;padding:0;"/>

This project aims to label Iranian state-sponsored propaganda for emotion using automated methods. Additionally, this project will evaluate various machine learning algorithms performance for correctly classifying emotion contained in the text based on the automated labelling.


<h3>About</h3>
<hr style="margin:10px 0;padding:0;"/>

This code runs the machine learning algorithms with the relevant data. This code contains functionality to:
  - Execute machine learning algorithms
    - with different features such as unigrams; bigrams; trigrams; unigrams & bigrams; and unigrams, bigrams & trigrams
  - generate baseline results
  - generate initial experiment results
  - generate experimental roesults automatically based on the baseline and initial experiment results
  - partition the dataset into various folds for evaluation
  - create features
  - store metrics
  - create results files
  - store all metrics for each experiment.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<hr style="margin:10px 0;padding:0;"/>

**Note:** it is recommended that you create a virtual environment (the code was created for Python 3.6):

    mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 emotion_detection
    workon emotion_detection


To install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy `dataset.py.example` to `dataset.py`

    cp dataset.py.example dataset.py


in `dataset.py`:
- Add the absolute path to the `dataset` variable (folder containing the dataset files)
  - e.g. `/home/USER/emotion_labelling/data/`
- Add an absolute path to the `output_data` variable for storing output data
  - e.g. `/home/USER/emotion_detection/output_data/`
- Modify other variables in the file as required
